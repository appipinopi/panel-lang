## Quick review steps

1. Download the zip and check strings in context.  
2. If you find issues, edit the files in the language folder and open a PR.  
3. For terminology consistency, propose a `GLOSSARY.md`.

Please keep placeholders and HTML tags unchanged. After edits, validate PHP syntax with `php -l`.

If you want, I can proofread and apply fixes — which language should I prioritize?
